= Page Event

Created by Marty Haught, January 2008

Page Event is a simple page-based event calendar for associating time-based events with your Radiant pages.  The original example was setting up meeting announcements in radiant where the meeting was a page.  Having this meeting show up on a site-wide calendar and having exact information on when the meeting was taking place was important.


INSTALLATION

1) Install Shards extension (unless it's already installed)

svn export http://svn.radiantcms.org/radiant/trunk/extensions/shards/ vendor/extensions/shards


2) Add the extensions config to environment.rb
	config.extensions = [ :shards, :all ]
	

3) Install the Calendar Date Select plugin with the following command:

svn export http://calendardateselect.googlecode.com/svn/tags/calendar_date_select vendor/plugins/calendar_date_select

I may slurp this plugin up inside Page Event at some point but for now I'll just leave it in its normal plugin form.  You can read more about it here:
http://code.google.com/p/calendardateselect/ 


2) Install the Page Event Extension




3) run migration

rake radiant:extensions:page_event:migrate

4) run rake update for extension

rake radiant:extensions:page_event:update


 

Tags:

List out the tags you can use with short descriptions


The main tag you'll use is the monthly calendar tag:

<r:calendar />

It will produce the current month's view with any events during the time.  The calendar also has previous and next month navigation.


For a specific event page you can access the date and time aspects of the event through these tags:
<r:event>
  Date: <r:date />
  Time: <r:time />
</r:event>

You can also do the tags inline such as: <r:event:time />

There currently are no options for any of the tags.  As this extension matures and gets used beyond a single site options will begin to appear.
